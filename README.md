Welcome to Shiva Khatri's Profile!
👋 Hello there! I'm Shiva Khatri, and I'm not just a web designer – I'm your gateway to captivating and user-centric digital experiences. With a passion for both creativity and technology, I've crafted a unique blend of skills that allow me to create stunning and functional web designs that stand out in the digital landscape.

About Me
🎓 I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Northern Kentucky University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. My academic journey has been enriched by a diverse range of coursework, including Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Database Programming(SQL). But it's not just about the classes – I thrive on real-world challenges.

What Sets Me Apart
🚀 Cutting-Edge AI and Edge Computing Integration: As a Research Assistant, I've dived deep into the world of AI, developing innovative models using open-source GPT4 and seamlessly integrating conversational AI with edge computing. This led to a remarkable 60% reduction in server workload in distributed systems – an achievement I'm truly proud of.

💻 From Code to User Experience: My software development journey has been exciting, from collaborating on a user-friendly customer portal using Angular and RESTful APIs to crafting e-commerce experiences that empower users to browse, search, and interact seamlessly.

📈 Data-Driven Decision Maker: I'm not just about beautiful designs – I thrive on data. I've harnessed the power of machine learning to create a Real-Estate-Price-Predictor with an impressive 85% accuracy. And with strong analytical skills, I've manipulated, visualized, and analyzed data to make informed decisions.

My Playground of Technologies
🛠️ Languages & Frameworks: Node.js, Python, JavaScript, Java, Typescript, HTML/CSS, React.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Redux, Express.js, Flask, Git/GitHub, Unix/Linux/Bash, and more.

☁️ Cloud Computing: Proficient in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

My Projects Speak Louder
🏠 Real-Estate-Price-Predictor - Predicting property prices with machine learning accuracy.

💡 Ideabook - Crafting seamless data management through a MERN stack app.

🎨 Art-Haven - Empowering art lovers to explore, search, and purchase paintings.

🤖 RSI-Based-Crypto-Trading-Bot - Leveraging Python and AI for automated crypto trading.
